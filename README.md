# Word Movers Distance Example
This is a simple example to show how to use WMD in pything. <br>
Note that you may need to install the [pymed](https://pypi.org/project/pyemd/) module to use the `wmdistance` function from gensim <br>

Feel free to play around with the sentences, e.g. what difference does it make if you don't clean the sentences? <br>
Similarly, can you create sentences which are semantically different but syntactically similar or with mis-spelling, e.g. <br>
<ul>
  <li>Can I edit my password</li>
  <li>Can I edit my life</li>
  <li>Can I change my passwodr</li>
</ul>  

What impact does the above have on the similarity score?
